547,500.  Thats how many child migrants we're set to detain in 1 year at this rate."
"3","1 out of every 1250 kids in the US was detained in the last month"
"4","Jesus Christ. Trump needs to be stopped, Congress needs to impeach immediately. Times up when genocide against children is going on."
"5","Impeachment might not be enough if we cant get McConnell to care."
"6","McConnell is up for re-election next year. I generally dont have a lot of faith in Kentucky voters (sorry, liberal minority in the state), but perhaps being tied to child genocide will finally push the turtle out of office."
"7","That would be nice, but I wish that there was something nonviolent we could do to Trump to get him out of office before January 2021.  McConnell wont ever move on removing Trump."

""Exactly. Make them Christians."""

"16","Urge Republican Senators to vote for a new majority leader. They could replace him at any time.  
This makes them every bit as guilty of all the things attributed to Mitch."
"17","At the very least we need to get McConnell and the other 21 GOP Senators up for election next year up front on not only the issue of impeachment, but the issue of concentration camps and child torture on the Southern border. 
Times like this I wish we *actually* had a liberal media that was willing to call these fascists out for their shit, not fuckers like Chuck Todd. Somebody sure as hell needs to shine a light on the madness enveloping this nation."
"18","I wish we actually had a liberal media that was willing to call these fascists out for their shit... 
We need to found something like this ourselves. 

All major media outlets are owned by the billionaire class. We will only ever know what they want us to hear. The liberal media was just as in favor of trump as they were Clinton. And now, theyre pushing Biden because he will still let the Republicans do as they please. They did not want Obama and they sure as hell don't want this new wave of ""socialists"". They like Dems that will work across the aisle because then the status quo is still in their favor, but they appear to be supporting progress...at a trickle rate."

Those Republican voters who want to be seen as caring tisk about how those poor kids wouldn't be in this mess if their parents had just stayed home.  It's willful ignorance and it should be publicly shamed as much as possible"
"26","What if we called them Christian refugees would that wake up the Mitch?"
"27","Nah, his base loves the idea of incarcerating brown kids."
"28","Impeach. Use impeachment as a political bludgeon. McConnell can not care all he wants while Democrats expose Trumps criminality and run against Republicans who do nothing about it."
"29","The fact he hasnt been struck down by a lightening bolt is proof there is no god."
"30","Why are we trying to predict the future? Air all the dirty laundry- launch a full fledge impeachment inquiry- prosecute those obstructing the investigation to the fullest extent of the law, and stop with these bullshit subpoena and contempt threats. Just do it already- let the people decide after presenting the evidence in a public forum for all to see. Then see if the senate still doesnt vote on this despite the overwhelming public testimonies and evidence. We need to stop predicting the future and justify our inaction through that- it only helps Trump. Show the administration that the house means business and stop with the bullshit theatricals."
"31","Impeach him for 60,000 counts of child abuse and child neglect. 
The Republicans can choose to either vote to impeach or give the sound clips defending their votes that will end their careers."
"32","Impeaching trump wont stop the flux of migrants but it may secure more humane conditions for them. Major economies need to stop taking advantage of developing nations if this shit is ever going to stop."
"33","Migrants are not the problem, just as blacks werent the problem 60 years ago.  Its the damn wealthy elite continuously pointing easily manipulated conservatives at brown people so theres less chances the lower and middle classes will unite and rise up against them.  The true reason people are miserable is the wealthy elite hoarding our futures prosperity...plain and simple.  Want to see things improve immediately in this country?  Tax the rich proportional to their assets.  Use that money to fix the states the rich bled dry or left for dead."

"35","Good point. I just find it hard to accept as the wealthiest nation on the planet that we have to force this people to be in these conditions. The families certainly dont need to be broken apart. 
Then again, I already know that this is all happening on purpose, the way they (Trump et al) want it to be happening."
"36","Hey, she needs those kids to suffer until 2020. How else is her buddy Biden going to appease centrists and still get minority votes?"
"37","Genocide? Are we systematically killing them all of the sudden? What are the alternatives? 
Do we just let everyone roam freely into our country, or are there 547,000 families willing to take in children? Do we need to find free permanent housing for all of these people coming in?

Everyone agrees this is a massive issue, but no one wins when you call this genocide - we should be talking about actual solutions and coming together to help people instead of pretending like this is Nazi Germany and doing nothing but complain about it."
"38","Its not genocide - yet"
"39","You dont know what the word genocide means."
"40","I believe you, I am just interested in where this number comes from.  This is horrible, but before I repeat this to otehr s I would like a source."
"41","I think theyre just basing the number by divided the number of children currently living in the US (or a projected number, [like at this site](https://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables/pop1.asp), by the 60,000 migrants detained number given in the original article.  
I got it to come up to 1 out of 1232 kids but it depends on what source you use for total number of 0 - 17 year olds in the US."
"42","*And remember, thats not counting adults. 
In other words, we're at genocidal-numbers of detainees."
"43","60.000 kids. Thats a town full of children. I wonder when they search for a solution for that problem. They could call it the final solution. Yepp, that would be a great name. 
[Insert /s here.]"
"44","Were probably a lot closer to something that atrocious than I want to think about."
"45","Im not right wing or anti-immigrant, but doesn't this mean the border has some serious security issues? 
Wouldn't need to detain people breaking federal law if they couldn't cross the border.

Just a note: I'm not American nor am I pro ""wall""."
"46","All refugees and asylum seekers are being detained in horrific conditions, not just those crossing illegally."
"47","This is what I was curious about. Im still getting downvoted like crazy though."
"48","This issue isnt exactly about border security or catching illegal immigrants (although that is frequently what is said), sneaking across the border in an attempt to find work. While those people are no doubt making it through, the issue is not about illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants are just deported, not kept in the US.  
The people in these camps are asylum seekers and they usually turn themselves in - they arent trying to cross into the country and disappear. What we have are massive numbers of people coming to US Borders and trying to claim legal status as refugees. 

The argument is between those who say we have a moral, legal, and ethical obligation to take in legitimate refugees (who meet the established criteria by US law and regulation) and those who say that these are not legitimate refugees but illegal immigrants trying to game the system in order to cheat their way to a legal immigration status. 

The disagreement is further complicated by one side saying that all immigrants,  except for Northern Europeans and possibly some Asians, are undesirable as new citizens and that we should have no or very little immigration from other places, even for those who really are refugees/asylum seekers."
"49","The disagreement is further complicated by one side saying that all immigrants, except for Northern Europeans and possibly some Asians, are undesirable as new citizens and that we should have no or very little immigration from other places, even for those who really are refugees/asylum seekers. 
I think you are presenting this in a dishonest light. The ethnicity of the people coming is of no concern to most people, it is their skill level, literacy, and ability to integrate into western culture. High skill immigrants are always going to preferable to those with low skills. 

&gt;they usually turn themselves in

They should be doing this at a legal port of entry in order to qualify as doing so ""without delay"" as to be protected by the US ratified treaty on the rights of refugees. Because they made the choice to try and cross the border covertly and without authorization they lower their chances of a successful asylum claim. Defensive asylum cases are something like 10 or 20 percent less likely be affirmed. Not that the percent of people who are granted asylum based on their claims is very high to start with."
"50","You have no idea who this person is or how many times theyve read anything. Your attitude is counter-productive."
"51","Anyone crossing without proper and approved paperwork is committing a crime. Whether they have applied for refugee status or not does not matter until it is approved and therefore they are held as illegal immigrants. Were not arguing legality though, the issue is how horribly all of these people are treated, illegal or not they should be treated as human."
"52","Welcome to politics, where common sense isnt so common."
"53","Also not American, but looked into it a lot. There is a lot of issues caused by policy changes. 
In April 2018 Trumps Justice Department announced that they would start prosecuting every illegal entry case referred to them by the Department of Homeland Security.

In May 2018 the Department of Homeland Security announced that they would start referring everyone who entered illegally for prosecution.

After-which, Trump gives executive orders dictate that families should be detained until their cases are resolved including Asylum cases which can take months/years...

It sounds like a lot more people are being detained and for much longer when compared to previous administrations due to these policies, and this is the end result. Its becoming very expensive and difficult to control the results of said policies."
"54","Its not illegal to seek asylum. The constitution is also clear that they are to be afforded due process. And this is beside the point because its children in a concentration camp. These people are coming here looking for help and were offering them stolen children, broken families, and concentration camps. There is no justification for this if you consider yourself a moral person."
"55","But logistically, theres a point where you have to change the constitution. Millions of people, whether theyre seeking asylum or not, cannot realistically flow into the country year in and year out. We just cant sustain that at all."
"56","Why would we be unable to sustain that? 
Our country is mostly open space, we have declining birth rates, immigration is down year over year for decades. We have millions of jobs that need to be filled, every immigrant that comes in is a net positive for the nation as a new tax paying, contributing member of society, and they have much lower rates of crime than natural born US citizens.

Theres basically no reason we couldn't take in more than a million refugees a year and we would be stronger for it."
"57","The population of California is 40,000,000. In 1970 it was 19,000,000.  
I can assure you that our infrastructure, freeways, transit, schools, housing, and other resources have not doubled during that timespan to keep pace with the population. 

There is today, massive overcrowding already. It is completely unsustainable."
"58","Maybe if there werent a small handful of states openly accepting of these immigrants and they had legal status here it would allow them to go to the literally millions of acres of empty land or tens of thousands of cities in desperate need of people to fill jobs. 
No one is going to trek across the country as an undocumented immigrant to set up shop in a state full of people who will report them to immigration because they stand out like sore thumbs.

Turn them into actual citizens, that changes dramatically."
"59","I just dont believe that our country could possibly sustain a 10% growth over the course of a decade and I see that being a realistic number if we allowed everyone in. 
It would be interesting to take some of that open land though and devote that to refuges and such. It could be an experiment in sustainability. See how a fresh batch of people does with completely new opportunity. Kind of like when people travelled west in the past."
"60","Why dont you believe that? 
Edit: what are the facts that are informing that opinion?"
"61","Rational thought. I cant see how 30 million new people over a decade will be able to work/live/prosper like youre arguing is possible. Shit, were at a point right now where the younger generations cant really prosper. America is on a downslide as a whole. We have too many people who arent able to have upwards economic movement."
"62","The population growth of America already sustains 30 million person population growth in a decade. Growth was at .9% annually for 2000-2010. 
Our economic issues are in no way hindered by immigrants. That correlation is propaganda. You should check out Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warrens policy proposals to see how we can fix our economic issues."
"63","Technically our country is largely unsettled. The immigration rush has never stopped, its just that each previous group of immigrants joins the group that wants new immigration to stop. Used to be the Irish that were hated, the Italians, etc, etc. 
The US is 177th in population density. There are 176 countries with more people per square mile than us. I don't even know 176 countries."
"64","Forget about the country being unsettled-- something like half our population is going to be dead in 30 years. We have a tidal wave of Boomer deaths coming. Whos going to fill all those jobs!? My generation doesn't want or cannot afford kids!"
"65","Is it millions of people? I dont think you have your numbers correct. Im pretty sure illegal border crossings have been on the decline for over a decade. We are not going to agree that there is an immigration problem. Why couldnt we sustain that? I think you are over estimating the issue."
"66","If there are over half a million children per year, then yes, there are over a million people total. These arent illegal border crossings so the numbers wont be there. These are asylum seekers."
"67","I see your logic but I think I need a more reliable source. I havent been convinced that an influx of a fraction of our total population is even an issue. Let alone asylum seekers coming here for help."
"68","I dont see an issue with a million people. Thats a lot, but they can be spread out and integrated into communities, most finding jobs, etc. The issue is the precedent that it sets. To allow every one of those seeking asylum, asylum, we *will* see a dramatic increase in asylum seekers year after year. As much as it sucks, fleeing a country because it is dangerous, and not because your government is oppressing you, shouldnt be considered a valid reason for asylum. People should stay in their countries and fight to make them better. We should help those countries be better."
"69","I agree with this We should help those countries be better. Through better foreign policy we can help these people establish governments that can keep them safe. Through trade deals we can help them establish an economy that works for their people. You dont think any asylum seekers would return home if their home were stable? You dont think less people would then seek asylum?  

I disagree with your reasons for asylum seeking. A government that cant keep its people safe is no government at all. I also think you have a shallow view of those seeking asylum. Many of them have fought and lost family and loved ones. Imagine what it would take for you to leave your home and go to canada to ask for help? These are desperate people. It seems you think of them as lazy, seeking handouts."
"70","They had been on the decline.  They are certainly not declining this year."
"71","You can increase security as much as you want, build as many walls as you want but if you dont improve the conditions these people are coming from then nothing will ever change..."
"72","Ah yes, because pushing the problem off onto Mexico is the only solution. 
How about recognize that the countries theyre coming from have actual problems, significant problems in which the US played a serious part in creating. You act like the rest of South America and then the rest of the world is just gonna start showing up in Mexico."
"73","Thats always been the case. But it is disingenuous to play it as a significant threat compared to the same possibility over the past 2 decades. 
And there's a big difference from a ""Gringo"" special and the better idea of ""stop fucking with them"" combined with ""work with them on aid and development plans""."
"74"," But it has done nothing to fix the problem. The migrants now just come from farther and poorer states. 
There are *much* fewer migrants today than at the height of the problem. Improving conditions in Mexico has done a *ton* to address the issue. Why would you say otherwise?"
"75","Not really.   
What would a giant wall do?  

These people arent detained crossing the desert. At least most them. 

They are detained crossing the border at the border crossing and legally seeking asylum.  

What do you do?  If you just say no they pile up on the border in the hundreds of thousands and create a humanitarian crisis. 

Well you can house them in shit tier conditions but this doesnt scale. 

Truth be told we have a border issue -  not a security one though a humanitarian one. 

The fix is to help South America so living conditions are well liveable. 

These people arent coming here thousands of miles often by foot for no reason.  They are fleeing an economy that doesnt exist.  

Trump has made this worse by cutting off aid. 

Would funding aid work and solve the border crisis no.  But it would help.  

Its a complicated issue requiring multiple complicated arrangements none of which trump and co are capable of.  And of course money -  but apparently we are paying 750 a day per person so money isnt an issue -  it needs to be better spent."
"76","Im not advocating for it, but if you simply denied everyone entry for a few years, and that humanitarian crisis pile up happened, you would eventually reach a point where people stop trying to reach the border because it would be fruitless."
"77","Sure but is this truly what you want? Only someone with no empathy would want this. America first doesnt need to mean America only."
"78","America first has nothing to do with it. Its literally not feasible to allow this to continue at this rate. What happens next year when its 3 million? And a decade later when its 10 million a year?"
"79","Thats sick though, isn't it? Is that really who we are?"
"80","Were a species that does a lot of things that are despicable when it comes to survival."
"81","Either way the answer is clearly not locking people, let alone CHILDREN, in a jail cell for this."
"82","Who knows, something needs to be done.  But shit whatever obama did kept immigration to an all time low and pretty sure it wasnt this.  By trump getting on tv blibbering racist shit and saying we are full has lit a match under the ass of people who had the thought to come here. Shitty part is(besides the camps) is the fact that we are paying for them to sit in jail basically and not work.  Let them out to work or send them back.  Putting them in cages is fucking savage and financially stupid."
"83","That is a reasonable question for someone out of the loop. And I appreciate you seeking further information. 
The people arent illegal immigrants. They are refugees and people seeking lawful entry through asylum and other means. The former policy was to process the applicants and let the make and living, contribute to the economy in the US until their day in court to plead their case.

The new policy is just to throw them in what can only be described as concentration camps until they are deported. Republicans use to say they were fine with people immigrating legally but these actions clearly show that is not the case."
"84","Thanks for this. Gives me a better understanding."
"85","*republicans USED to say"
"86","I am of a similar mind. If accurate, the numbers suggest that there is a serious security issue. And, of course, with a border that large, there are going to be massive challenges securing it. Its an inherently insecure. The problem is that a wall is only a minor deterrent for anyone with a ladder, shovel, or boat.  
As I understand it, many or most of the people coming in are *not* Mexican but from Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatamala.   So, what the hell is Mexico doing? Are these migrants sneaking through Mexico over the course of days or weeks?  Are they making the trip while working and gradually moving north? How much should we expect Mexico to police this? Is that even practical for them? It would seem way easier if we paid for a wall on *Mexico's* southern border instead."
"87","These arent border crossers looking to just disappear into the country, they're asylum seekers. We turn the vast majority of them away, and they do actually go. This does not suggest that if we shut down everything Trump is doing, the country would suddenly be taking on ~1.5 million extra immigrants a year."
"88","Fair point. It was unclear what percentage were coming via official ports of entry. Republicans blaming ""child smugglers"" implied there was a significant number of surreptitious crossings, but thats not necessarily so. I live in TN, so I don't actually have a great grasp on the everday details on the ground."
"89","Also a TN person here... this is where neither the media or the opposition party is doing a good job of portraying the reality of the situation. For the average citizen who isnt reading up on the issues, illegal immigration, child separations, and the wall are all one issue.  
The fact of the matter is that there is a massive humanitarian crisis of legal asylum seekers caused by collapsing economies in Central America and a fear that there will be nowhere to seek asylum from violence and poverty soon. These people are being separated from their children and being held in inhumane conditions until they can go through a Constitutionally protected legal process. 

Separately, we have a bunch of people trying to sneak into the country illegally. That number is probably ticking up with the number of people trying to get in legally and the counts have increased with increased policing. 

Trump and the GOP want these issues mixed because legal immigration is bad for Republicans as a larger percentage of immigrants vote Democratic. TX is already in danger of going Blue in 2020. Losing a red state with that many electoral votes would be devastating to the party and would reshape American politics considerably. 

Trump's approach here is to hope that the public just sees all these people as illegals so the government can treat them like criminals and hopefully dissuade more people from coming."
"90","From a fiscal standpoint though, why are we paying for asylum hearings for one and a half million people per year if we just deny most of them. It would make sense to just deny everyone since a majority seem to be abusing the system, or at least the system views it that way. Its a huge waste of resources to try to filter asylum seekers in these numbers."
"91","Well, during the second World War, that was the policy.  
Canadians and Americans alike turned away fleeing Jews who were later gassed to death. 

The world agreed we should agree to save fleeing people if we could prove their claims were true. 

Here we are today with children being put in cages and people asking why asylum?'

The Holocaust is why"
"92","But we *know* that a country isnt committing genocide. People are fleeing their countries because they are falling apart, shitty with gangs, etc. The world as a whole cannot just take in everyone from such countries. The countries themselves need to be fixed."
"93"," The world as a whole cannot just take in everyone from such countries. The countries themselves need to be fixed. 
Well, arent you civilized /s

Central American countries have been ravaged by American drug policies. To so callously allow such interference in other countries' affairs (not to mention the wars in ME) and *then* to pretend like your country has no responsibility to the displaced peoples of the world is a level of hypocrisy I am amazed to be encountered with over and over again. 

No man is an island. Grow a conscience."
"94","People seeking refuge and asylum from violence caused by US policies are not ""security issues."" 
 They are chickens coming home to roost, and they are what some guy called ""the least of these."""
"95","Seeking asylum is not illegal. I advocate a Central American Marshall Plan to help solve the perceived immigration problem. If things were not such a shit show in the home country a lot fewer people would pack up their lives and make the trek."
"96","lol I feel the same in europe we also lock up illigal immegrants before we send them back or they are granted to stay.  Somehow they american liberals have gone nuts and think it is normal that 100.000 of thousands are crossing there border illegal and offer no sollution to this problem, or even aknowledge there is a probleml. Also they lay no responsability by the parents and ignore that there are people make a lot of money in mexico getting these people over the border. 
These are very strange times, Im a liberal leftwing even some might say a socialist. Yet the level of ignorance and dumbing down on the left side of the political spectrum is unbelievable. All they can do it seems is fling mud, lie for a 'good' cause and cry like babies how evil the otherside is. But offer no solutions themselfs."
"97","I share the exact same sentiment as you."
"98","[Well...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bijsl9p55qot=39) /s"
"99","That is so fucked..."
"100","If 1 American child was detained in this state by a foreign actor, it would be front page news and a huge diplomatic incident. More than one could be war."
"101","Funneling nearly $1K per child per day into the Prison Industrial Complex"
"102","About 20k less than the state of Wyoming."
"103","And multiply that times $750.00/day minus costs, so like $747.43/day."
"104","It isnt standard international law to require refugees to seek asylum in the first country they can. That was part of an agreement the EU made that was specific to them, its not a universal rule. 
Some of them are seeking refuge in Mexico, but if they feel like they still won't be safe enough in Mexico, there is no reason they can't keep going to the US or Canada."
"105","Did not know that, thank you for the info. 
If I was in their shoes I would totally want to take refuge in the US. We have the strongest economy and are extremely safe compared to most countries in the region. However, what worries me is that we cant just absorb everyone in Central America and elsewhere you wants to join us. There is a limit to what our economy can handle (especially if we plan of giving them benefits like social security, Medicare, and others)"
"106","I get those concerns, but theyre going to keep coming regardless of what we do at the border as long as the conditions in their home countries are so bad. We need to invest in those countries to help ourselves."
"107","Wow, I can actually get behind that sentiment. Private (American) investment into central would be great for both countries - sadly tariffs while useful in our specific case as a negotiating tool, make attempts like this next to impossible. 

I would be totally fine with this happening though. China is doing something similar in Africa right now - build infrastructure in tons of poorer country and give a ~30 year loan to said country. When the loans expires if they can pay it back you made some money, if not you now exercise some control over that country.

Edit: Also thank you to everyone for having a conversation about this. Often times differing opinions just get down-voted to oblivion and ignored."
"108","Not only is Trump in a bad position to negotiate a deal on this, but hes actually pulling back on aid the US gives to those countries to combat poverty, drugs, violence, etc. He sees it as us being ""tough"" on them to force them to get their act together, but really it's just reducing their capacity to actually deal with those issues, which will make the migration problem worse."
"109","Personally Im against all forms of foreign  ""aid"". I'm extremely pro-foreign investment though. If we are sending millions/billions overseas we should be getting be acquiring ownership of something or debt of some kind. 
I agree though that trump is in a terrible position to negotiate a deal. I would say though that if I wanted a wall (I don't want a literal wall) I would do exactly what Trump is doing. Burn all the other bridges and leave America with one feasible option: a ""big beautiful wall"""
"110","Foreign aid is already an investment. We dont go around giving money away if we don't think it will benefit the U.S. in some way."
"111","When I say foreign investment I mean deals that in which countries or companies go into debt to the US."
"112","Foreign ""aid"" is kind of a misnomer in that we rarely ever do it just for the sake of helping. Usually we spend money in other countries so it will benefit us in some (often intangible) way."
"113","Bechtel invested in Bolivia."
"114","Okay. And?"
"115","Youre the one who expressed interest.  It's a US company that invested in in Bolivia.  There are other companies that invested in central America if you want other examples."
"116","Im saying the US government should put more resources towards improving central American states."
"117","You just want to drop them off at the border immediately after picking them up?"
"118","I think they should give them some paperwork, take their fingerprints, and bus them 50 miles back in Mexico. They then can come to a port of entry at a set date and have an immigration hearing. We need more judges though. It is unfair for us and them that there is a multi year waiting period."
"119","If they are Mexican citizens they have to accept them - no choice in the matter. And I believe that (surprising enough) Trump managed to negotiate something with Mexico where they agreed to take the Central America migrants in - this might only apply to the caravans though. 
Whatever the situation is though the solution needs to involve more immigration judges. They should have their hearing within 1 week of entering the US before they are released into the country. That way we no longer have the issue of migrants skipping their court dates and staying illegally."
"120","Okay this is a fucking concentration camp"
"121","Two things, how many of those Children have since been released, and second, I dont want to take in that many people a year, period, that's not counting the adults and it isn't counting the 1.3 million legal immigrants we invite every year.  
I'm a democrat, I'll never vote for Trump, but if anyone's wondering why he gets votes, its partly shit like this. 

Someone good at geography tell me how many countries someone from Honduras walks through before they reach this country. And then someone tell me how many of those countries are safer than Honduras. And then someone explain to me why these folks aren't forced to claim asylum in the first country they enter after leaving their own, as is common practice in Europe."
"122","When I read the NewYork times they say that Journeys a thousand or more miles. If we're being honest, do we assume the shortest path is the one being used generally?"
"123","What Im trying to ask is if there are countries these people are walking through they could ask for asylum in before they hit ours, besides Mexico. And apparently the answer is no."
"124","They could ask, but that is not how it works. 
x200B;

Anyone seeking asylum is also allowed to cross borders and turn themselves in while inside the country.  The reason for that is because countries like to form barriers to prevent those people from successfully applying for asylum."
"125","And frankly Im fine with that. My feeling is that we take asylum seekers until we feel too overwhelmed. And it's been standard practice for at least this administration and the last to get Mexico involved in stopping these people before they reach us. Most of these people should be claiming asylum in Mexico anyway. They come here, because if given the choice between living here, or in Mexico, who would choose Mexico? Our own immigration numbers say almost no one."
"126"," dont want to take in that many people a year, period, 
They are coming here already. So what's the solution? I don't think there is a good one short term. But keeping kids in concentration camps is certainly not a viable option. Long-term we need to be investing in these south/central american countries like Honduras to improve conditions there and slow the number of asylum seekers coming to the U.S."
"127","First, we dont keep the kids there long term. That's why the term concentration camp is wrong. It's 21 days max, so when you see a headline that says the US has detained sixty-thousand children this year, most of those kids are now living in the country because they've been handed off to sponsors already here. The law that demands we separate children from anyone who isn't their legal guardian existed before this administration. Its confusing because last year, Trump did something new, and bad, by separating children and their biological parents, but this current child separation issue existed in previous administrations. 
And I don't want to invest money in those countries. I want both the ability to stop the migrant flows and not to be blackmailed by these countries. Its like they say, ""Give us money or we'll keep sending you people."" And I don't know why we assume throwing billions of dollars at failed states is a good idea. I'm uninterested in doing it.

The only reason we have a foreign aid budget is to buy allies, to put it bluntly, and if a country can't take care of its own shit, we don't need that country as an ally."
"128","Its 21 days max,  
Kids are being separated from their parents and held for literal weeks without basic necessities in overcrowded conditions. Let's not minimize it. 

&gt;And I don't want to invest money in those countries. I want both the ability to stop the migrant flows and not to be blackmailed by these countries. 

Who's blackmailing us? No one is ""sending"" these people. Conditions where they are from are terrible and so they are leaving. How should we expect conditions to improve without some sort of investment? Sticking our head in the sand and saying ""not our problem"" doesn't solve anything. And it very much IS our problem as evidenced by the people coming here to claim asylum. 

You have a very simplistic view of foreign aid, something that attempts to address a very complex problem."
"129","Careful. I got murdered down below because I said our camps arent death camps and that maybe those (setting up camps) were the best option because what the fork else are we supposed to do with this many refugees all at once. Just bombarded with people basically calling me an ass. 
Edit: I dont mean death camps are the best option I mean some sort of temporary processing camp"
"130","I know. And Ive been having the same conversation for a week, and I don't get it. It seems like people who comment on here think everyone who makes it here should be allowed to stay here. 
And look, folks, as much work as we recognize needs to be done to make this country better, there are plenty of people who'd do anything to live here, because where they live sucks. And not just because its poor, or violent, but because all the rights you take totally for granted like freedom of speech and being able to vote in your leaders and freedom of the press don't exist where these people are from, and that's too bad, but I'm not interested in granting either refugee status or citizenship to anyone with a sob story. 

And its also important to note, for all the rhetoric out of this administration, we're taking in migrants, illegal and otherwise in huge numbers right now. And Reddit's solution's to pay out huge sums of money to these corrupt failed states, and I'm not interested in doing that either. 

I don't want a wall. I just want to deport people who we that our courts tell us are deportable."
"131","At around $700/day if I recall."
"132","Serious question: Ok, so say the concentration camps get closed. What do we do with the people? 
We can harp on the evils of camps all we want but I havent heard anyone proposing a functional alternative. Remember, we are dealing with numbers in the hundreds of thousands."
"133","Time to rise up and tell your representatives this needs to stop. Someone is making a fortune off of their misery ($750 per child/day). If you live near a holding facility join a protest on July 12th (Lights for Liberty). Find as many petitions to sign, tell your friends and family what is going on and you could even make flyers to hand out. So many people have their heads in the sand because of their tired of the insanity but we must join together and stand against this tyranny. We can do this America - We are so much better than this!"
"134","Thats roughly one child a minute for 40 days.   
x200B;

ONE CHILD EVERY MINUTE.  OF EVERY DAY."
"135","Its a crazy ass number. At this point you have to ask, why the fuck are half a million people a year wanting to get imprisonment in the US over live in their homes? If its so bad then maybe the US should be helping?"
"136","Are there even this many child migrants to detain? Google puts the US population at 327 million, this would be a third of a percent of the total US population in child migrants alone, each year.  
Where are all these people even coming from and why are the choosing to be here? And this doesnt even count the adults. If you added two adults to that number we'd surpass half a percent of the total US population. Who are attempting to immigrate to the US every year. Those numbers are just insanely huge. 

Not to defend Trump's actions, but wtf? These numbers are just huge. Another google search says 44 million people are foreign born in the US, or 1 in 7. Is it really any wonder part of the current population is upset about this? Call it racism if you want, but there's nothing normal about this level of immigration."
"137","They should probably stop coming then...."
"138","The government isnt going to kill these children Jesus Christ guys."
"139","If a child dies because of neglect and lack of basic resources after being stripped from their family and being detained in conditions even our most vile felons arent subject to...the government is killing them."
"140","Letting them flood in and be homeless would kill them too. Yall are a bunch of hive minded fools. I hate Trump but I dont see a good way around hundreds of thousands of migrants showing up at once in any situation. Germany did the same thing when they let immigrants in, they built big camps for the Syrians. Were not sending them back at gunpoint."
"141","I live in an area with both large homeless and migrant populations. Dont see too many homeless migrants. And there are better ways to handle these flows of people, but it requires compassion and money. People seeking asylum are attempting to follow the law. It is also much more humane and efficient to process and release people and deport them later if they fail the process. Ripping apart families and detaining kids in squalor is not humane, productive, or helpful in any way. It is intentionally cruel and should be stopped immediately."
"142","Yes. I live in Los Angeles and my wife is first generation Mexican-American and our child is 2nd gen. I can still use my brain and see this as a terrible situation and not jump to the US is running migrant death camps conclusion because anti-US hyperbole helps nothing."
"143","Nobody said death camp the word is concentration camp. The hyperbole is yours.  
Concentration is the appropriate term. The fact that neglect and abuse are rampant in these is an added horror to this particular situation. Not a coincidence that these are run for profit and staffed by people fed on anti migrant rhetoric pushed by a white supremacy friendly administration."
"144","Actually when I first commented there were *plenty* of people talking about death camps and how they were going to find mass graves. That was essentially my whole point. That people were being hyperbolic."
"145","You actually said the government isnt killing anyone. I responded that the government is killing people if a kid dies due to neglect or illness caused by the conditions. Yes, there are no ovens, but the current policy is punitive and unnecessary. Subsequent deaths can be blamed on the policy and those executing it. There are alternatives, especially considering the current policy isnt achieving the goal of deterence."
"146","We resettled over a hundred thousand Vietnamese easily enough within a very short time. We have processed way higher levels of immigrants and refugees through out most our history."
"147","They dont kill most, but are you really comfortable with some of them dying?"
"148","I didnt say that either. What would you do with these millions showing up at the border right now? I dont think there *is* a good solution but everyones making this out to be some situation where they were rounded up and thrown in jail like the Jews in WWII. This is a humanitarian crises surging into our border and we have a bunch of absolute morons in charge that cant handle it. They took Obamas systems offline without adequately coming up with their own plan. But if they (the migrant children) get past the border and all become homeless in the streets thats not ideal either."
"149","thats not ideal either. 
Thats quite the equivocation.  At least they would have toothbrushes and freedom.  The only downside I can think of is people would whine about homelessness again, but if their alternative is literally to concentrate homeless children in camps, fuck them."
"150","You process them. 90% have family already here. You send them to their family members. You schedule court dates and interviews. Like we have always done before.  
You start to look into why exactly so many are so desperate that they are willing to take this hazardous journey and see what we can do to help create a better environment in their home countries- like support indigenous peoples rights to their own land, and stop our companies from buying it up. Enforce laws against our predators that take vacations in Guatemala where they rape children forced into sexual slavery. 

Fuck- start addressing climate change that is destroying traditional crops, and finance agricultural alternatives. 

There are tons of ways to address refugee issues that dont include torturing people and abusing children."
"151","I dunno man, the torturing and abusing is way easier than all that other stuff"
"152","Thousands, not millions.  The government could build some apartments or something.  Id pay higher taxes for that. 
These people are just as hard working, capable and intelligent as any other human being.  If you give them the chance to flourish some of them will, and their successes will pay us back many times over.

If we let them in and treat them like people we at least have the opportunity to benefit from the people who, let's face it, are gonna keep coming anyway."
"153","Jesus. Hundreds of thousands of people *right now* and the government could build some apartments or something.  Are you serious?"
"154","Im gonna level and admit to reading very little of what you wrote initially and assumed some things that were incorrect.  I owe you a better response than the flippant one I gave. 
I see you aren't just being a jerk, you have real points that need addressing one way or another.  Right now our solutions aren't up to our own standards.

Truthfully I am not smart enough to come up with a real solution to this, but we can do better.  Even if we make some barracks we can at least give them basic care, and we can afford toothbrushes and soap, a few doctors, some teachers maybe.  We could set up those donation bins in stores for food and toys and supplies, even if it only barely helps.  Maybe we could allow volunteers in to help, which could help keep the standards up.  We could have sad commercials for paying for the migrant related stuff rather than dogs and stuff.  We could stop the demonizing of immigrants, and lying about what their intentions are too.

Caging non-white refugees and immigrants and separating them from their children.  Caging their children and through neglect allowed literally any of them to die.  Raiding communities... These make me feel ashamed of being an American.

I think there are genuinely enough people in this country that would like to help those in need that we could come up with a better solution than what we have.  Though from the very top we just aren't trying to help on a fundamental level, we are trying to scare them off."
"155","The US could both absorb this many people (since many already have US civilian family ties here) and stop working to destabilize Central and South American counties that wont let US companies exploit their natural resources for rock bottom prices to solve this."
"156","2016: ""There wont be any camps for children, Jesus Christ Guys."" 
2019: ""They're not even *trying* to kill those kids in the camps yet!""

You can fuckin leave if this is the hair you're going to split, because your track record sucks."
"157","2019: its totally a manufactured crisis. 
2019: omg, it's a crisis!

Talk about track records."
"158","They dont have basic necessities there. 
There is no reason to hold them there.

Morally, every preventable death that happens there is murder."
"159"," The government isnt going to kill these children 
Source?"
"160","this is a disturbingly high number"
"161","He lies about everything, I wonder if the administration (read: Miller) is inflating or flat-out lying about these numbers to justify their actions and rile up their base. How many times did Trump accuse the Obama administration of false reporting (the jobs report comes to mind)?"
"162","Id be more concerned they are underreporting."
"163","And what would their incentive to underreport these numbers be? It costs the government $750+ *per kid per day* to pack them into cages with minimal care and aluminum space blankets. Thats an absurd number. The contractors doing this are making millions off the federal gov't to commit human rights abuses--the owner of the largest detention centers is the top donor for three Texas congressmen. Who's keeping track of and counting all these kids and the billing process? If the government reports more kids than there are, the contractors can bill for more than they received. With this administrations (and GOP) track record on corruption, I'd be more surprised if there *wasn't* some kind of grift happening."
"164","I meant deaths."
"165","Im more alarmed by whats causing all these migrants than the actual detentions.  
How can the US just let its global neighborhood go to blight so badly?"
"166","Let it? They actively played a role in it - see [Operation Condor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor)."
"167","*sigh*"
"168","Many are fleeing violence from gangs. Meanwhile more than 50% of traceable guns in El Salvador and Guatemala are traced back to the US, and 70% of guns in Mexico.  
Gun sales abroad push migration, migration pushes domestic gun sales."
"169","The gangs are being directly supported by the US government anyway."
"170","War on drugs and imperialism"
"171"," How can the US just let its global neighborhood go to blight so badly? 
Because like with all superpowers our people have become decadent and narcissistic, drunk on the power bestowed upon them. Go look at how fucking Reagan and HW Bush talked about these migrants in the 80s. As much as I dislike them, they witnessed the great depression and WWII and honestly, that meant the WWII generation could at some level empathize with the poor conditions people elsewhere in the world lived or live in. The generations after that have all grown with privilege and riches and its gone to their heads.

Oh, and racism, cant forget that with America."
"172","Central America is a fucking mess because of US interference for at least a hundred years. 
Learn your own countrys history, ffs"
"173","Its so bad, like it or not the immigrants with the money they send back to these countries are actually making a better job to stabilize the region than anything the US has done. 
It's such a mess."
"174","Vox did a good explained podcast about it last week: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/voxs-the-weeds"
"175","I question those numbers.

"177","Ah, yes - the data guy. Thank goodness people like you exist. Here is my upvote."
"178","That data easily could support 60k in 40 days. 
May showed 11k unaccompanied minors, and 84k families. Pretty likely at least half of the families are children. That makes 53k kids in 30 days, make 60k in 40 right on track."
"179","That was a heavy dose of here comes the /s and then not be the case. Bamboozled me you did."
"180","Why with everything going on would the number of total people apprehended be going up? Are there more people or is the CBP getting more aggressive?"
"181","There are a TON more people coming in. Look at FY18 compared to FY19 current numbers. They are damn near double"
"182","What would the cause be? Are situations in central and South America deteriorating that quickly? Or is US illegal immigration becoming more popular again? 
At what point does the US invade Guatemala?"
"183","Cant say. I haven't really looked into it."
"184","Too many factors to consider but mainly political instability. 

-Honduras (election stolen by corruption/gangs)


-Nicaragua (Ortega killing/capturing dissidents,  supressing protests)


-Guatemala (Populist president turned out to be a crook/gangs)


-El Salvador (Mostly gangs and poverty). 

Not sure wtf is going on though, those numbers do look inflated but who knows?

My guess is that the highest number is from Honduras, theyre going through very bad economy and there is no end in sight."
"185","Idk man. If in may 11k unaccompanied minors and 84k family units. If even half the families are kids, thats 53k in 30 days. 
Seems like the data absolutely does support it. Especially since women with children are like half of the migrants"
"186","I thought about that but the historical is low so I based it off that. Youre absolutely right that it can certainly happen with the current s the US is taking in"

While other areas like Ohio have received a larger than normal amount of rain/wind and thus made much of the land unusable. Only 1/3 of Ohios farmland is in use this year. Apparently there will also be losses to berries, nuts, and peanuts as well. There will likely be huge increases in produce costs as the year goes on.

"253","When the alternative is cartels slowly boiling everyone in used motor oil feet first, it will take doing exactly this in every town square in America to even come close to being a deterrent. Then our transformation into White Daesh will be complete."
"254","Open question. Would a solution be to just fly these people back to their home country? Wouldnt that be cheaper/faster/more humane? This is assuming they have identification from their country on them."
"255","They are seeking asylum, that needs to go through a process."
"256","They are drug war refugees.  Nothing to go back to."
"257","A Boeing 747 (the really big one) can hold 660 people at most. That would mean close to 100 flights to shuttle 60k people. Assuming 12 hour turnaround time (also keep in mind they would probably fly back empty) and 2 dedicated planes, (worth ~$150m each, used) that means it would take 45 days to shuttle everyone back. Youd need 23 flights or ~12 active planes to shuttle 15k people per day. 
Assuming average ticket cost of $500 (big assumption, given that they fly back empty and still need fuel/staff), thats $330k per flight or $7.5m for 23 flights.

Also keep in mind not many airports can receive a 747, so youd need more smaller planes and more flights.

Also, these people are running away from crumbling infrastructure, starvation, war, gangs, etc, so to fly them back means probable death.

So to answer your question, probably not going to happen."
"258","And thats just the children."
"259","Thanks for that information. Based on the economics you mentioned I would agree that seems like an incredibly expensive option and not realistic."
"260","Then how would the ow ers of these private camps make money?"
"261","While a high number, its partially a result of the rather large surge of migrants at the border recently, so a lot of people in general have been detained by turning themselves in. The fact that they're detained on its own isn't concerning to me, as it's a part of the asylum process. It's that the way they're treated after that's the issue."
"262","Exactly. The principle of detaining asylum seekers isnt bad. But the reality we are seeing is indefensible. We have the money and resources to accommodate these people on a basic level. Yet we are learning that *kids*  arent even getting the simplest of necessities. No human being should face inhumane conditions, even convicted criminals. Thats the cornerstone of human rights. But a substantial chunk of the population agree with this administrations cruelty and immoral behavior."
"263","We have the money and resources to accommodate these people on a basic level 
Right, so why is Congress withholding it and blaming CBP while it begs desperately for those resources?"
"264","If they cant do it for 775 per person, per day, they don't deserve extra. That's how much they are getting already. You should be asking where all that money is going."
"265","Seriously does anyone know where this money is going?"
"266","And the fact that theyre separated from their parents. Even ""tender age"" children."
"267","Im just curious because I honestly only keep reading that people are upset and that everything going on at the border is shit. Also before I ask just a Note: I don't support or condone any of this crazy shit going in I just genuinely wanna know how would or should we fix the issue at the border. Like what do we honestly do with all these people and their kids? How do we provide? How do we give those people due process into the states? What do we as a nation do?"
"268","the USA is the richest country in the world.your own poor people are a result of decades of a failing system exploited by the ultra rich. you havent done much to prevent that as a voter, you're electing the wrong people. the dire situation of many of your own is a direct result of that. 
that being said, you could easily accommodate all these people, give them a place to live etc., if you stopped supporting oligarchs. this of course is NOW a very difficult task.

however the main issues to tackle right now should be hiring more judges to speed up the process of granting or not granting asylum so people do not have to be detained for a long time.

also of course accommodate these people in bigger and better facilities immediately. the money is there, it is just not used for the right purpose and apart from certainly a lot of individuals lining their pockets with contractor money, there is the probably bigger issue of incompetence.

it is not easy to organize accommodation of a rapidly growing number of people. it can be done however, if you hire capable people. that's not happening."
"269","The simple stuff 
* Good record keeping. Even nazi style numbering would be better.
* Faster processing. Hire more judges and lawyers.
* Give them basic amenities. If the trump administration doesnt want to pay then allow donations.
* Get the BP/ICE to work with aid charities to house the immigrants. 

Actually solving the problem:

These people are fleeing violence back home. This needs to be dealt with, not increased hardening of the border. 

Start at home. 

* Restrict gun sales and stop the flow into central America.
* Increase the foreign aid budget. Do this by increasing higher rate tax. 
* Better international relations. Work with foreign governments to help them stabilise their country. Subsidise their police, or help with anti-corruption drives.

These are at least a start."
"270","I thought that was literally ICEs job? 
So to be fair they are probably arriving and being rounded up."

"276","What was the previous average for such a time?"
"277","These 60,000 children being detained would not have been detained under the Obama administration. Obama did, however, detain children who were unaccompanied. 3115 were detained in January 2016, for example. But over 6000 were detained in December 2015. 11,507 UAC (unaccompanied children) crossed in May, 2019. Not the 30,000 Trump would have you believe. Most of the children came as part of families and were then separated and detained. 84,542 people with their families crossed and were detained, the majority of those being children. Under the Obama administration, NONE of those would have been detained. 
Now, lets keep in mind something pretty incredible. *These are children who are awaiting trial to determine whether they can legally reside in the United States. They were *not* immediately seen as inadmissible. Those children are immediately turned around at the border.* For example, 11,391 were turned around at the border in May, 2019. This is why the Trump administration is so vastly different than all the previous. He is detaining people who would not have been detained in the past. In the past, most of these people would have been allowed to stay in the US with relatives/host families until their trial.

Also, keep in mind the past 15 years are *nothing* compared to the 1990s-early 2000s. In the year 2000, 1.6 *million* people were apprehended at the border. On average, that is 133,000 people every single month. That's more than 2019's largest month.

Take a look at the numbers more closely [here](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration). You don't see any large jumps in the numbers until March 2018 and then another large jump in February 2019 and March 2019. That's not a coincidence. March 2018 was his first family separation policies. February 2019 was when he tried to push for the wall and failed. March 2019 he announced closure of various immigration offices along the border. Coincidentally (or not...) the largest jumps in immigration during those periods are families.

;tldr Trump has helped manufacture an immigration crisis by closing immigration offices and detaining children who would have previously not been detained."
"278","We are witnessing multiple south american countries collapse almost simultaneously.  This isnt just economics, this is nations literally burning under the sun, no food, no water, forced migrations."
"279","Uh, America? Stop?"

"285","This is what the Doom of Valyria looked like before it was called such."
"286","The broader issue I dont hear discussed in the border debate, is what the policy will be when the current crisis becomes an actual migrant stampede of millions of people from both central/South America and also Asia and Africa.  As those locations become less and less hospitable to sustained agricultural practices over the coming decades, they will come to the US - like they are fleeing to Europe now. 
The cages are terrible.  But we cant just release anyone who brings a kid with them.  We need a system that isnt a free for all because a free for all will fuck us in the future."

"291","Honestly there isnt a perfect approach to this problem. 
Plan A: Send people back to their country of origin. Obviously this is not going to work and people will want to get to US not matter what. 

Plan B: Allow a limited number of people where the number is actually manageable by the border patrol. This makes sure that those being housed for asylum have proper resources and are most importantly treated properly. But with the limited amount of people allowed the problem in plan A will still arise. 

No matter what a compromise will be required."
"292","theres rarely a perfect approach to any big problem like this"
"293"," Honestly there isnt a perfect approach to this problem. 
There never is. The most perfect approach is increasing border security funding in exchange for Dreamers being given citizenship and funds and diplomacy for joint missions with Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador etc to defeat non-state military groups and gangs for good, to bring about stability in those countries."

"299","so I guess Im wondering how this is not a border crisis?"
"300","I dont understand what many people on this thread want the alternative to be, infrastructure doesnt exist to accommodate this many migrants. People keep trying to come across the border even when they know they are going to be detained. What would you have the government do?"
"301","Because some of those sponsors are illegal themselves! Why would we let someone we know is illegally here take someone? Then you got Nancy Pelosi saying today a violation of status is not a reason for deportation?!?!! No wonder people flocked here before trump came its almost impossible to get deported from the US with this kind of thinking. We catch you here illegally, theres an order for your deportation and yet you got the Democrats saying thats not enough to get deported"
"302","People cant be illegal. The sponsors are U.S. citizens and are vetted before kids are released to them. This is (was) standard practice."
"303","We cant. Nancy Pelosi says thats not enough reason to deport them"
"304","[Wasnt this crisis caused by recent policies though?](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/21/17488458/obama-immigration-policy-family-separation-border) 
1. In April 2018 Trumps Justice Department announced that they would start prosecuting every illegal entry case referred to them by the Department of Homeland Security.
2. In May 2018 the Department of Homeland Security announced that they would start referring everyone who entered illegally for prosecution.
3. After-which, Trump gives executive orders dictate that families should be detained until their cases are resolved including Asylum cases which can take months/years...

It sounds like a lot more people are being detained and for much longer when compared to previous administrations due to these policies, and this is the end result. It's becoming very expensive and difficult to control the results of said policies, perhaps they should be looked at again and reviewed."
"305","Not to mention assuming all children are unaccompanied unless the parents fulfill unrealistic requirements to prove the kids are theirs. Working those loopholes to inflict maximum cruelty."
"306","This is one of the biggest misconceptions I see on social media. Family separations for the purposes of deterrence do not predate the Trump administration. Before Trump, including under President Obama, immigrant families were only separated if border agents believed that a child was in danger, such as when they suspected that a person claiming to be a parent was actually a human trafficker, or if the parent had an extensive criminal record that could impact their ability to keep the child safe. 
Its true that border agents have always had discretion in deciding who is a danger to a child and who is not, but interviews that my colleagues and I have conducted with career officials (as opposed to political appointees) at federal immigration agencies suggest that separations are far more common today than they were under any previous administration. The ongoing separations are being tracked as part of a federal lawsuit out of the Southern District of California, for those who are interested. Im linking here again to a recent story I reported with my colleague Miriam Jordan, which helps to explain: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/us/migrant-family-separations-border.html  - Caitlan Dickerson"
"307","I would have government let the kids stay with their parent(s) for one. There is NO reason for them to go through this kind of traumatic experience alone. At least with the parents at their side, the rape/molestation of these kids would be lowered significantly."
"308","People go by ""feels"" but none of these folks will ever care, host, or house any one of these thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants coming in every month.  60,000 child migrants in the past 40 days?  Goodluck to any country handling that."
"309","This is a null argument. They have relatives and could be released into their care as in the past. Were keeping them in the Immigrant Industrial Complex."
"310","Meaning that all of these kids would become citizens or that they would be sent back to relatives in their countries of origin? If the current administration started sending people back to Guatemala there would be people saying its cruel to send a minor to an unstable country. It seems like the consensus on this sub is to just take in a constant stream of unaccompanied minors, which I dont see as a reasonable solution. That would only encourage more illegal immigration. How many hundreds of thousands are we willing to take in as a country every year?"
"311","The vast majority arent unaccompanied, this administration defines all kids that way. They are so ""smart"", they work the loopholes to inflict maximum cruelty."
"312","What do people have to gain by being cruel. Do you really believe elected officials are working loopholes to cause pain to children, or do you think it probably more complicated than that?"
"313","You mean the elected official who wants to execute people proven innocent or pardon war criminals and law enforcement that bragged about running a concentration camp or wants to torture the families of suspected terrorists or who admires dictators infamous for their human rights abuses or who constantly lies and abuses their power in an obvious effort to demonize entire groups of people....the list goes on. Not to mention people appointed by said elected official. So, AB-SO-FUCKING-LUTELY do I believe cruelty is the point. Anyone who doesnt is either willfully ignorant or a sick fuck enjoying the suffering."
"314","""So, AB-SO-FUCKING-LUTELY do I believe cruelty is the point. Anyone who doesnt is either willfully ignorant or a sick fuck enjoying the suffering"". 
so there are three types of people: ignorant people, sick fucks, and people who think that trump became president for the expressed purpose of torturing families etc. Doesn't seem to logical to me. Based off of your response I think that ignorance is a little more widespread than that"
"315","  trump became president for the expressed purpose of torturing families etc. 
Haha. Nah, thats just a side gig but critical to the overall authoritarian agenda. His main purpose is obviously to take from the poor and give to the rich."
"316","No. They have sponsors in the United States, verifiable family connections. They could stay with them until their asylum hearing."
"317","Maybe they should give them showers but instead of water they could use something else.. seriously though, if we can come up with 600b for bankers - + 14t in low interest loans - we can work this. Treat it like a disaster and have fema manage it."
"318","People are trying to volunteer and donate. Theyre being turned away. Free legal aid is also being sent away. Wake up. This is our America. Past time to act."
"319","decades past time to act. but its NEVER too late, unless youre dead"
"320"," Lets go with the rational conclusion, there is a surge of people....more than usual showing up,  
How is that rational? It requires the assumption that the current administration doesn't lie their asses off at every given opportunity. But, no, let's believe in their good intentions. Maybe if you close your eyes hard enough, the world will look like a better place?"
"321","Nope, its not necessary to detain everyone the way they are doing. They could simply reinstate [Obama's successful program](https://qz.com/1312707/trumps-family-detention-policy-vs-obamas-more-humane-alternative-to-jailing-immigrant-families/) that was MUCH cheaper. But, that doesn't create a crisis or inflict cruelty... that's what this is all about.

"326","Trump turned down $25,000,000,000 in funding when he had a unified Congress under Republican control."
"327","There could be a procedure where we send them back to their parents for one. Why do we keep the children and send the parents back? We could create an infrastructure to deal with this in a humane way."
"328","great question. what happens to these children? will they ever see their families again?"
"329","They dont know what families to send them back to. They have no clue. 
If you can't repatriate someone because you don't know where they're from than you would think you would have to make them a citizen. All these toddlers have no clue what country they're from. The best way to stop illegal immigration clearly."

"335","1st procedure would be stopping the separation....."
"336","First procedure stop crossing the border illegally. Most are not crossing at designated stations, most cross in the middle of nowhere and when caught claim asylum just like they were taught before coming this far."

"338","""Hmm why would a parent take such a risk with their children? Could it be that their situation back in their home country was so bad they saw basically no other option? ...Nah its probably bad parenting."""
"339","infrastructure doesnt exist to accommodate this many migrants. 
I just want to point out. If you tax the rich or had states actually use their budget on infrastructure tou would. Boarder patrol only uses 6% of its actual budget on Boarder security.

&gt;I dont understand what many people on this thread want the alternative to be,

Open boarders duh. At least make it easier for illegal immigrants to become legal citizens if they already have a life in America. Have a fair tax.

Also, stop generally treating illegal immigrants like animals. Why do you think it's ok to treat the immigrants in these camps so bad? It's been reported that over 3000 children have been sexually assaulted by ICE workers and all you guys do is shrug and say they shouldn't be here. That isn't a justification for being horrible people."
"340","So your advocating to change tax law in order to achieve a better solution at the border, that might be a long term solution. I also dont know if your serious about open borders, i hope not. Regardless, I am all for immigration reform which makes it easier for people to enter the country legally with some kind of work permit or provisional citizenship. However that wont stop the flood of people at the border. Barack Obama said, We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently, and lawfully to become immigrants in this country.  
Also I don't know if you are telling me to stop trying to treat immigrants badly, because I don't have any interaction with people in the detention centers. Obviously people shouldn't be unnecessarily treated badly, nobody is saying they should. I am confused by your use of ""you guys"" as if you know what groups and political affiliations I belong to. Just because someone has a different viewpoint then you, doesn't make them a trump supporter lol"
"341","doesnt make them a trump supporter lol 
Never called you a Trump supporter weird projection. 

&gt;hope not. 

Why not it worked for the EU that was till racist pretended it didn't 

&gt;So your advocating to change

I'm pointing out the only reason why illegal immigrants are ""bad"" is because people claim they don't contribute to society. They easily could with a change in tac law. Why would it matter if someone was illegal or not if they were contributing the same way as a legal citizen.

&gt;I am all for immigration reform which makes it easier for people to enter the country legally with some kind of work permit or provisional citizenship.

I'm talking about the ones already here and working. Why shouldn't we help those people get citizenship?

&gt;I am confused by your use of ""you guys""

People like you show up in every post about something horrible happening in these centers. Trying to make it not sound horrible or switch the blame. I'm kinda tired of it. I'm tired of how casual you guys make horrible thing come off."

Why do we only hear about the children every so often, it seems like an out of sight out of mind situation with the US and when someone speaks out we get worked up again then the coverage dies down. If the we could see and hear about this daily I feel like we would be doing more to stop this."
"347","I dont understand how no one is freaking  out about the 60,000  migrant children entering our country illegally in just 40 days. Its staggering! and this statistics isnt including adults.  
Thats a mind numbing amount of people being intercepted daily. We scream when the gov trys to build new detention centers and scream when the existing centers are ill equipped to Handle this insane amount of bodies  but what do you expect. This is a crisis on our border think of the man power needed to handle these people In a safe and sanitary fashion.

Think how difficult it is to document this many people 
To ensure children are actually with there real parents 
To ensure that they are protected from predators and violence.
How do you even go about houseing all these people in safe and sanitary conditions. 
Its a massive disease issue. 60,000 small children enter with no vaccinations coming from third world countries were old sickness still exist. 
How do you keep it from spreading in facilities bursting to split 
Think How much waste they produce how can any facility handle this many people!!!"
"348","What is the margin on how much they spend detaining these children versus how much they are given per child?"
"349","Can someone explain to me why they arent just sent back immediately? Why are they being detained can't they just send them back to where they came from and end this whole thing? Or is detaining them some sort of show of force by the president to deter people from coming into the country"
"350","you didnt hear about the mandatory DNA tests ?because the majority of kids being brought arent related to the people that brought them there  
If this is news its because you live in a bubble and only read things that support your opinion try searching for yourself and gain a different perspective"
"351","Also I think youre missing my point that the situation is being worsened by people kidnapping or renting kids bringing them to the border..

"362","Yes, it is.  Watch and learn"
"363","We should give them all free houses, free food and $50,000 a year just for being in the US. And when I say free houses, free food and $50,000, I mean for every member of the family. You bring 6 kids illegally into this country (something you can do anywhere else on the planet), you should get 6 houses, enough free food for 6 people, for life and $300,000 a year. They totally deserve it."
"364","Im actually somewhat surprised at the apathy of the American people. If this happened in any eurpean country there would be people rising up in arms long ago. Big brother really has brainwashed the left to be passive and just take it."
"365","The Dem politicians actually talked about it quite a bit- now they talk differently for some reason...

Democrats on immigration in the past.... Obama,Hillary,Bill,Schumer"
"366","As an American, I am ashamed but totally agree."
"367","Most people arent. There will be protests on July 12 in Texas. Try to join them if you can"
"368","Its JUNE TWENTY FOURTH WTF ARE WE DOING"
"369","mmmm. just wondering what the reason could be for them to INFLATE those numbers... 
nothing suspicious/S"
"370","US taxpayers are forking out $22000/month **EACH** for these children to be held in inhumane conditions.  
60k children cost us $1.32 BILLION for 1 month. 

Keep that in mind next time someone tells you universal healthcare and education are too expensive."
"371","I think your math is a bit off..  $1.33 billion/22,000 is 60k. Im pretty sure theres more than 60k taxpayers."
"372","Cost of one child is $22,000 per month 
Multiply that cost by 60,000 children and you get about $1.32 billion for one month, a cost that is being paid by the taxpayers. And thats only for the children who have been detained in the last 40 days."
"373","I feel this is effetively an attempt at curbing 2045 when whites are the minority, and Latino folks are the majority. This way, the few white people can still be in power because anyone of latin decent will be severely emotionally damaged."
"374","This stat is oversold,  which doesnt make it any better.  Many Latinos are white, so whites will still be the majority. Also, people arent voting against republicans necessarily because they are minorities or otherwise.  They are voting for a better America.   All that means is this is genocide because they assume brown people will be against them no matter what.  Wonder why?"
"375","This sub is a circle jerk"
"376","I think its safe to say that this 'circlejerk' extends far beyond this sub. It's as if most humans are born with this moral compass that tells us this is wrong, and needs to end. Keyword is ""most"" humans. For whatever fucked up reason, some people think it's OK and will defend the practice."
"377"," america is so fucking stuck up their own asses. we intentionally broke their system and cry like little babies when we get some repercussions of it. the boy who cried wolf x1000000000000. i say let them come freely, this is exactly like turning the jews away during the holocaust in WWII which we did. lets not make the same mistake twice. even tho we already are and will continue to do. oh america"
"378","Parents force them to this.... they should be considered accountable."
"379","Parents dont enforce the family separation policy."
"380","Yeah plus officials could always just release them back into the community to wait for a trial since illegal entry is a misdemeanor unless its a repeat offense."
"381","Parents know what the consequences are for breaking the law are. They do it anyway."
"382","Sociopath family values' conservatives - 'We'll torture the kids cos their parents tried to legally claim asylum! It's what Jesus would do!'"
"383","You are contradicting yourself. Why would they cross the border illegally if they want LEGALLY ask for asylum? 
This would blow all their chances to get approved. 

x200B;

Wake up and good luck."
"384","Wow its almost like crimes are illegal"
"385","These are children asshat."
"386","So? Still a crime buddy"
"387","And when there parents commit crimes where the fuck should we put them? Whats your solution. Because its pretty damn simple dont come in illegally and you dont get separated"
"388","So you are telling me 60,000 people committed actual crimes in the USA and their children were taken away put in cages without proper care?"
"389","Technically, they are breaking administrative law and not criminal law. Thus, they arent technically criminals."
"390","How do you process that many ""asylum"" claims every month or so? No nation can afford this."
"391","How do you process that many ""asylum"" claims every month or so?  
Easily, by sending funding for the judicial process instead of billions for an ineffective wall.

&gt;No nation can afford this.

But we can afford to waste billions on the military and trillions on the rich?"
"392","So 1.3 billion every month for these kids isnt enough but 10 billion for a wall is too much?"
"393","So 1.3 billion every month for these kids isnt enough but 10 billion for a wall is too much? 
Yes! It's not enough for the kids because the fascists are using private companies that are profiting from this cruelty. 

It's too much for a wall that won't address the vast majority of illegal immigration."
"394","I beg you, WRITE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE #

"395","You know how to prevent this. Dont cross illegally."
"396","Yeah.  Just stay home and get killed by the cartels, or starve to death  

Your lack of humanity is disgusting"
"397","Number of Americans who gives a shit: 0 
Thats the unfortunate truth. Write as many angry articles and comments as you want. But if you're not on the streets or actively fighting these camps you're equally complicit. 2 million HKers gathered together to protest against a law proposal, a freaking proposal. 

Meanwhile kids are literally being murdered in these camps and Americans are barely moving their asses. 

What a sad display."
"398","This crisis was manufactured by the trump administration with Jeff Sessions zero tolerance rule and the trump administration threatening to close ports of entry."
"399","Stephen Millers and John Kelly's brainchild."
"400","He *did* close immigration offices at the border, making it harder for people to legally enter and caused the the backlog of trials, forcing the children to stay in these camps for longer periods than ever before. He also did family separation. In the past, most of these people would be staying with relatives and host families until their trial dates."
"401","We used to process these kids for Asylum. 
Your President created this crisis.  But you dont care."
"402","Fun fact: These kids *are* being processed for asylum. Every single one of these kids being detained are being detained simply because they *might* be allowed to stay in the USA legally. The ones who were saw as definitely inadmissible were already returned. They are waiting for trial to plead their case. The USA turns away thousands of people every months. These children are the ones they *didnt* turn away. 
The difference is that in the past, these kids would have been allowed to stay with relatives, kept with their families, or if young enough, given host families to take care of them while their trial awaited."
"403","Obama had more asylum seekers and handled it without concentration camps. Seems Donny is just incapable"
"404","[lol wut](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration)"
"405","the crisis is capitalism and imperialism."
"406","Were and have created the crisis :("
"407","You forgot to add the fact that they were kidnapped and brought there by people who arent their parents so they could circumvent the law..I dont like any of this but lets be clear WHY kids are being kept there"
"408","No, its really not. See https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c4xi7j/60000_child_migrants_detained_by_us_in_last_40/erzr1kf/"
"409","Sorry dont care enough to read the whole thing.. did it say anything about fake families coming to the border ? People grabbing kids like Billie Zane on the titanic ? Because  thats whats happening."
"410","Please give me proof that it happened 84,000 times. I have a citation in my link above, so please provide yours."
"411","No, you dont ""think"" that. You've been told that and mindlessly repeat it, along with your zombie friends who repeat the exact same thing."
"412","No thats not something that's repeated its just my thoughts, seems like you mindlessly block any idea that conflicts with yours."
"413","Ive read that exact same phrase online from hundreds of different people. I'm sure each one of you thinks you're so ""original."" The bleating of other sheep sound so different to each other, but to anyone standing outside, it's all the same blah-blah-blah. 
There are also hundreds of different responses to your bleat. Each one different, each a valid argument, each one exposing the many different ways you are wrong. How come you never read them? Is it because.... you mindlessly block any ideas that conflict with your own?"
