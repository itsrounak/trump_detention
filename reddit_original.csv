They are detained crossing the border at the border crossing and legally seeking asylum.

For the average citizen who isn't reading up on the issues, illegal immigration, child separations, and the wall are all one issue. 

The fact of the matter is that there is a massive humanitarian crisis of legal asylum seekers caused by collapsing economies in Central America and a fear that there will be nowhere to seek asylum from violence and poverty soon. These people are being separated from their children and being held in inhumane conditions until they can go through a Constitutionally protected legal process. 

Separately, we have a bunch of people trying to sneak into the country illegally. That number is probably ticking up with the number of people trying to get in legally and the counts have increased with increased policing. 

Trump and the GOP want these issues mixed because legal immigration is bad for Republicans as a larger percentage of immigrants vote Democratic. TX is already in danger of going Blue in 2020. Losing a red state with that many electoral votes would be devastating to the party and would reshape American politics considerably. 

Trump's approach here is to hope that the public just sees all these people as illegals so the government can treat them like criminals and hopefully dissuade more people from coming.","60,000 child migrants detained by US in last 40 days","","https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-48602222/60000-child-migrants-detained-by-us-in-last-40-days?fbclid=IwAR3ubKECRlX4wRPsDJy3XaleEQLCugnVM2O4k8BwUNLSLP_igW2FocAVhZU","bbc.com","https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c4xi7j/60000_child_migrants_detained_by_us_in_last_40/?ref=search_posts"

I responded that the government is killing people if a kid dies due to neglect or illness caused by the conditions. Yes, there are no ovens, but the current policy is punitive and unnecessary. Subsequent deaths can be blamed on the policy and those executing it.

Truthfully I am not smart enough to come up with a real solution to this, but we can do better.  Even if we make some barracks we can at least give them basic care, and we can afford toothbrushes and soap, a few doctors, some teachers maybe.  We could set up those donation bins in stores for food and toys and supplies, even if it only barely helps.  Maybe we could allow volunteers in to help, which could help keep the standards up.  We could have sad commercials for paying for the migrant related stuff rather than dogs and stuff.  We could stop the demonizing of immigrants, and lying about what their intentions are too.

Caging non-white refugees and immigrants and separating them from their children.  Caging their children and through neglect allowed literally any of them to die.  Raiding communities... These make me feel ashamed of being an American.

Obama did, however, detain children who were unaccompanied. 3115 were detained in January 2016, for example. But over 6000 were detained in December 2015. 11,507 UAC (unaccompanied children) crossed in May, 2019. Not the 30,000 Trump would have you believe. Most of the children came as part of families and were then separated and detained. 84,542 people with their families crossed and were detained, the majority of those being children. Under the Obama administration, NONE of those would have been detained.

Now, let's keep in mind something pretty incredible. *These are children who are awaiting trial to determine whether they can legally reside in the United States. They were *not* immediately seen as inadmissible. Those children are immediately turned around at the border.* For example, 11,391 were turned around at the border in May, 2019. This is why the Trump administration is so vastly different than all the previous. He is detaining people who would not have been detained in the past. In the past, most of these people would have been allowed to stay in the US with relatives/host families until their trial.

Also, keep in mind the past 15 years are *nothing* compared to the 1990s-early 2000s. In the year 2000, 1.6 *million* people were apprehended at the border. On average, that is 133,000 people every single month. That's more than 2019's largest month.

Take a look at the numbers more closely [here](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration). You don't see any large jumps in the numbers until March 2018 and then another large jump in February 2019 and March 2019. That's not a coincidence. March 2018 was his first family separation policies. February 2019 was when he tried to push for the wall and failed. March 2019 he announced closure of various immigration offices along the border. Coincidentally (or not...) the largest jumps in immigration during those periods are families.

;tldr Trump has helped manufacture an immigration crisis by closing immigration offices and detaining children who would have previously not been detained.","60,000 child migrants detained by US in last 40 days","","https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-48602222/60000-child-migrants-detained-by-us-in-last-40-days?fbclid=IwAR3ubKECRlX4wRPsDJy3XaleEQLCugnVM2O4k8BwUNLSLP_igW2FocAVhZU","bbc.com","https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/c4xi7j/60000_child_migrants_detained_by_us_in_last_40/?ref=search_posts"

Its true that border agents have always had discretion in deciding who is a danger to a child and who is not, but interviews that my colleagues and I have conducted with career officials (as opposed to political appointees) at federal immigration agencies suggest that separations are far more common today than they were under any previous administration.
